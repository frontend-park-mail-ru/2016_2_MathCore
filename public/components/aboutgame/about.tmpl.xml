                        <p>Previously lived aliens have left their treasures. You should find and carry on your spaceship
                            to the last crystal - or your opponent will be the first! </p>
                            <p>Three important points:</p>

                                <li>The game based on Jackal Game: the scale of Treasure Island</li>
                                <li>The playing field consists of a square chip, spread randomly face down. This means that every time you learn the island again.</li>
                                <li>Battle rules are such that the impact is minimal chance: the outcome of the battle depends on your tactical abilities.</li>

                            <div class="description__theme"><span class="_bold">How to play?</span></div>
                            <p>The space ships swim the island, "competing" teams are planted. You control three astronauts,
                                who can move around the island, find crystals, fight with other pirates,
                                or perform special actions. The winner is the one who can not only find the treasure,
                                but also to carry them on his ship,
                                one of the most interesting strategies lies in the interception of those who carries gold. </p>
